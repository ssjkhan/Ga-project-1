## Next Steps

1. Quality of Life Improvements:

   - Improve delayed action lockout for playermoves to avoid speedrunning incentives for gameplay.
   - Introduce a variety of ships and orientations for further strategic depth.
   - Enable HUD for remaining ships in the battle.

2. Technical Challenges:
   - Enable cross-network PvP.
   - Allow player selection of fleet and placement of ships before the battle rather than random placement.
